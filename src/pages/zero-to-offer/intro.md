Zero to Offer is a Pitt CSC 'course' aimed at arming students with the knowledge and confidence they
need to try to land the internships they want. These are notes from that course.

> TODO: Disclaimer

## Who is this for?

Whether you never coded before or if you have been trying to get an internship for 3 years without fail, Zero to Offer is for you.

## Why?

Internships are a great way to expierence a new city, meet new friends, potentially secure a full time
position, learn new skills, and get paid (a lot).

If you are going to stop reading, just remember: _Apply Everywhere and Apply Early_

The advice given in the Zero to Offer is for a 'top tier' internship.

People tend to categorize companies on tiers based on pay, benefits, and name recognition. You might
think the 'better' the company is, the happier you will be. This is not true. In fact, it is
very possible you can learn a lot more working at a small company no one has heard about vs working at
a Google.

At Pitt CSC, we do not like to call companies 'top tier', but the companies that pay higher and have better benefits are harder to get into.

### Perception

I need to work at Google to be happy

### Reality

- So many factors (location, work, team, company outlook, benefits, etc) will determine how happy you are
- There are soooooo many companies out there

> You do not need to work at a 'top tier' company

So, think about why you want to intern. Are you willing to put in the effort to try to intern at a 'top tier' company?

This is broken up into 5 parts. Happy reading!
