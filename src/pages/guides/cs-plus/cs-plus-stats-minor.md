## How to start and how to progress

So you wanna become a stats minor? Well it does have a few considerations. Let's start off with making sure the course you choose the right course for completing the SCI's mathematics course requirements. The requirements that you need 12 credits of math classes, with 8 pretty much coming from Calc 1 and Calc 2. And typically the rest coming from stats but there are three options...

- STAT 1000 (Applied Statistical Methods)
- STAT 1100 (Statistics and Probability for Business Management)
- STAT 1151 (Introduction to Probability)

So, in going for the stats minor you will want to take STAT 1000 as it's one of the base requirements. But what about the other two, well the STAT 1100 is basically the same as STAT 1000 except won't help you to much for going further in other stat course. And for STAT 1151, this is a theoritical course and not an applied one so it doesn't complete any minor requirements but has potential to open the door to more advanced stat courses. You might need to additionally take STAT 1152 (Introduction to Mathematical Statistics), but it will allow you to enroll into STAT 1321 (Applied Time Series), STAT 1731 (Stochastic Processes), and STAT 1651 (Introduction to Bayesian Statistics). But with that I highly recommend if you are not a statistics major then you rather not take STAT 1151 or STAT 1152. Partially because there are plenty of statistics courses that don't require you to take any theortical statistics. And partially because some of these higher level courses are taught by David Stoffer; many students, including myself, find him not to be a very good lecturer and a person to avoid (I really wish this wasn't the case). If you need evidence of this statement view his rate my professor.

tl;dr: Just take STAT 1000 and you'll be ready for what's next.

## The Next Class: STAT 1221 (Applied Linear Regression)

This is the only other defined class besides STAT 1000 that you are required to take for the minor. This course will start building up your modeling knowledge, and fun fact linear regression is a machine learning model. This course will just get your running with a lot of fundamentals that, depending on what courses you do next, will be built up into more specific versions including logistic regression, lasso regression, ridge regressions, etc. and how they can be used in classification and regression tasks.

## Paths

Congrats, you now have a primer in statistics :D. But now what to do next. Here are a few paths of courses to take depending on what knowledge you would like to gain.

### The Data Scientist Path

This is probably what most CS majors are looking for. How does one make models and be able to predict stuff? This sequence is fairly simple it goes...

> STAT 1261 (Principles of Data Science) -> STAT 1361 (Statistical Learning and Data Science)

These courses are typically offered in order with STAT 1261 in the fall and STAT 1361 in the spring. STAT 1261 is basically just an introduction to R, tidyverse, and Edward Tufte's principles behind making visualizations with just a touch of machine learning. This course will get you very comfortable with manipulating data in R and creating really nice visualizations of your data in no time. In my personal view, R is a beast at doing all things data (seriously I rather do data manipulation and visualization in R over Python any day). This is mostly thanks to Hadley Wickham, this course is basically learning how to use all the tools he made.

Then next course is probably one of the most eye opening, well taught, and amazing statistics course the exist at Pitt. STAT 1361 will get your into the world of all the different models, resampling methods, random forests, etc. The homework for this class is time intensive but worth every moment as it really gets you understanding how the models work and how to use them. You'll also be introduced to a fundamental concept of all models, the bias-varience trade-off. This class will basically check off the part of any data science job app. talking about have you had experince with linear regressions, LDA, PCA (kind of), random forests, etc. And a plus to it all the lecturer who teaches it, Lucas Mentch, is an amazing lecturer. During his lecturers he will make sure you understand the main concept of what's being taught, and even ask questions to the students in a way where it's ok to be wrong because he will guide you to the right direction.

And that's two classes done. The third is a little bit up to you but I highly recommend taking Applied Nonparametric Statistics. The reason is because nonparametric statistics is essentially a bunch of different statistical tests and methods that avoid making assumption about the data (specifically that the data is normal).
