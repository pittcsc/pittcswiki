Computational Biology is a joint major offered by both the Department of Biological Sciences in the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Computing and Information. Students can declare this major after completing BIOSC 150 and 160; CHEM 110 and 120; and CS 0011 or an equivalent placement test with the Python language. Students may also declare the major and choose to be under the Dietrich or SCI. Note, there are substantial differences between the two which are outlined [here](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/computational-biology).

Starting in 2018, the bioinformatics major was replaced by the new Computational Biology major. This new major offers more core computer science courses and decreases biology requirements. Many required courses are now aligned with most graduate health science schools (medical, dental, etc.) which allows more flexibility. In turn, it is now a popular track for students wishing to go into graduate research, industry, or aforementioned graduate health science schools. In addition, some courses are currently being streamlined and students will be the first to attend some of these “revamped” courses for the new major. 

In general, this major is quite broad. Computational Biology has numerous sub categories ranging from evolutionary biology, systems biology, medicinal chemistry, and more. Consequently, this major isn’t the most specialized and students should expect a broad overview of methods in biology that computation is useful for rather than a specialization in a certain subfield. 

Fun facts: 
*   Completing CHEM 110, 120, 310, 320, and BIOSC 1000 will automatically complete the chemistry minor. 
*   Completing the core CS courses and taking CS447 will complete the CS minor. 
*   CS is increasingly becoming a valuable skill for healthcare workers and researchers. 

Before Declaring:
*   CS 0011 or equivalent in Python: CS 0008 is a possible alternative (offered more often and more flexible timing). Contact your advisor to see if it’s suitable still.
*   BIOSC 150: This course covers biology topics such as cell structure, genetics, metabolism and photosynthesis, and foundational chemical concepts. This class is intended for natural science majors and is decently intensive. An honors course is available. 
*   BIOSC 160: This course covers biology topics such as evolution, ecology, reproduction, and biotechnology. Similarly, this is somewhat intensive. An honors course is available.
*   CHEM 110: This covers the first half of chemistry topics from atomic theory to thermochemistry. An honors course is available. Note, a lab is included in the course. (4 hours once a week)
*   CHEM 120: This covers the second half of chemistry topics from acid base chemistry to thermochemistry and bonding theories. An honors course is available. Note, a lab is included in the course. (4 hours once a week). 

## Major Coursework
Co-requisites:
*   MATH 0220: Calculus 1
*   STAT 1000: Applied Statistics

Core CS:
*   CS 0011 or equivalent, CS 401, CS 441, CS 445, CS 1501. Note that CS 401, CS 445, and CS 1501 are currently offered only in java. It is recommended in the time between CS 0011 and CS 401 that you quickly learn java syntax. 
*   1656: Introduction to Data Science: Overview of data science technologies and techniques: data management, manipulation, analysis, and presentation. The course will cover SQL, XML, Xquery, RDF, SPARQL, Graph/Cypher along with topics such as information retrieval, data mining, and other topics. This course is taught in Python. 1501 is a prerequisite and statistics is highly recommended. 

Core Science:
*   BIOSC 0350: Genetics
    *   Somewhat advanced level genetics course that goes deeper into foundational concepts covered in BIOSC 150 and 160. Not the hardest course, but work is definitely required. Jacobson is a popular professor choice.
*   BIOSC 1000: Biochemistry
    *   Extremely tough course, probably the hardest of the major. Would highly recommend decreasing credit load this semester to a minimum (12-14). Extremely fast paced, combines advanced biology concepts mostly studied in BIOSC 150 with chemistry concepts from 110, 120, and organic concepts from 310 and 320. However, this course is extremely important for studying physiology, systems biology, and metabolism. Erica Mcgreevy is a popular professor. Laura Zapanta is popular as well. 
*   CHEM 0310: Organic Chemistry 1
    *   A notoriously difficult course. Requires a deep understanding of chemistry fundamentals and the ability to visualize 3d structures of molecules in certain conditions, environments, and perspectives. Recommended that the student takes a light schedule as well (13-16 credits) when taking this course. There will be a lot of studying required. 
    *   Topics covered: nomenclature, stereochemistry, radical chemistry, 4 reaction mechanisms, alcohols, alkenes and alkynes.
    *   Most professors are fantastic choices: most notably: George Bandik, Paul Floreancig, Peng Liu, Tim Tseng, Scott Nelson, Seth Horne (Honors). Most professors will teach CHEM 0320 the following spring. 
*   CHEM 0320: Organic Chemistry 2 [elective]
    *   Substantially more difficult than organic chemistry 2. Many reactions will be taught. Topics build upon organic 1 knowledge. Topics covered: carbonyl chemistry, carboxylic acid chemistry, carbohydrate and proteins chemistry. Also recommended the student takes a lighter schedule (13-16 credits) when taking this course. 

Core Bioinformatics
*   BIOSC 1540 (fall only)
    *   Very basic course intended to “give students a broad understanding of how computational approaches can be used to solve problems in biology. Both the biological and computational underpinnings of the methods will be addressed”
    *   Will use R for projects
*   Computational Genomics (Spring in even catalog years) OR Simulation and Modeling (Spring in odd catalog years). example: Spring 2019 was BIOSC 1542 (genomics). 
    *   Genomics: Computer-aided methods to generate and test biological hypotheses at whole-genome scales. Students will gain both a theoretical and practical understanding of working with genomic data typical of high-throughput sequencing technologies. 
    *   Simulation / Modeling: Computational structural biology, simulation and modeling, as seen through the lens of a rational, computer-aided drug discovery. Topics will include protein structure and modeling, cheminformatics, virtual small-molecule screening, molecular dynamics screenings, molecular visualization, and online resources for studying proteins and molecules. A class project will allow students to apply the relevant tools. 
    *   Both courses allow the student to choose which specialization interests them the most. Both courses are intensive given they are a high level course, but will be the most applicable of the core bioinformatics which should prove to be one of the most enjoyable ones. 
*   BIOSC 1640 (spring only) or CS 1640 (both fall and spring)
    *   Depends on school
    *   Both are involved with bioinformatics software design and research. Courses are somewhat new and most students will be taking these as the courses’ first iterations. 
*   Seminar Comp Bio (1630, fall only)
    *   Writing requirement for the major. Not much information is available on this course, but it’s likely not intensive and is the “1501 W requirement” of this major.
