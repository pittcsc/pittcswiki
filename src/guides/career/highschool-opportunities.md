Getting internships in college is an excellent way to gain real-world experience, network with industry professionals, and start building a strong resume. However, many students aren't aware of opportunities that are open to, and some specifically for, high school students. These opportunities often go unnoticed and can be hard to find if you don't know how to look for them. We encourage you to share this list to raise awareness about these awesome opportunities, some directly related to CS, to get hands-on experience in high school!

## High School Opportunities

| Amazon Future Engineer | The Amazon Future Engineer program sponsors the Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship, a scholarship that provides up to $40,000 towards an undergraduate degree in engineering or computer science as well as an offer for a summer internship at Amazon. From anecdotal evidence on Reddit, a few hundred students are selected each year. Note: The email stating an applicant won the scholarship may go to the recipient's high school teacher instead of the student themself.

| NASA OSTEM Internships | NASA hosts internships for high school and college students across a wide range of disciplines, including communications, programming, lab research, and more. Many internships are open to high school and college students, with a few exclusively for high school students. Note that most, if not all, NASA OSTEM internships require applicants to be U.S. citizens.
