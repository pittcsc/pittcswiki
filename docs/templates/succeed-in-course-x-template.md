title: "Succeeding in course X"

TODO: Succeed in course X guides serve to give students an overview of the course and a practical step-by-step guide on how to do well in the course. Most of the content should be specific to the course so that there isn't too much repetition between the guides in this category.

## **What is course X?**
TODO: Explain what the topic actually is. What is deep learning? What is discrete mathematics? What is computer programming? We don't want our readers to walk into the first day of lecture only knowing the title of the course, they should have a sound understanding of what they're going to learn. Give an exciting and detailed explanation of the topics they'll cover.
- Topic 1
  - Explanation of topic 1. What is it? Why is it useful? What are some examples of it?
- Topic 2
  - Explanation of topic 2  
- Topic N
  - Explanation of topic n  

(Use the course syllabus for reference when making the list of topics.)
 
## **Why do we study x?** 
TODO: Sometimes we learn things without ever being told why it's important. Explain some practical implementations of this course and why it's important. Give examples of how it could help the reader in the future. 

## **How to succeed in x:** 
TODO: This is the beginning of the practical guide. 

### **High level ideas**
TODO: Here's your chance to give broad, high level advice that is course specific and will give the readers the proper mindset to start the course. More miscellaneous advice can go here. 
- **Piece of advice** (e.g. start your coding projects early)
  - **Explanation** of why it's important (e.g. you'll often get stuck and if you start early, you can get help in office hours)

### **Specific section 1**
The header of these sections should be the topic that you'll elaborate on in paragraph form. Some examples of headers would be "Readings, Preparation, The textbook, Coding projects, Homeworks, Exams, Quizzes, Recitations, Studying, Office Hours, External resources etc". Elaborate under each of these sections how to properly navigate that topic.

### **Specific section n**  
Elaboration on specific section n.  

## **Conclusion:**
Wrap up the guide with an encouraging message :)

### **Other recommendations for writing the guide:** 
Reach out to professors who teach the course and get their input on the guide. It's also helpful to reach out to UTAs and students who did well in the course to get their input.
